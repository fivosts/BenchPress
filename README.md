:orange_book:  __BenchPress: A Deep Active Benchmark Generator__, *PACT 2022*.

__BenchPress__ is a directed program synthesizer for compiler benchmarks. Using active learning, it ranks compiler features based on their significance and produces executables that target them. __BenchPress__ is very accurate in generating compilable code - 87% of single-shot samples from empty feeds compile - while remaining light-weight compared to other massive seq2seq generative models.


## Installation

See `INSTALL.md` for instructions.
