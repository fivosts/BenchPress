__BenchPress__ is not a only directed program synthesizer for compiler benchmarks. Using active learning, it also ranks compiler features based on their significance and produces executables that target them. __BenchPress__ is very accurate in generating compilable code - 87% of single-shot samples from empty feeds compile - while remaining light-weight compared to other massive seq2seq generative models.

__BenchPress__ has been accepted to PACT 2022. See the attached paper for more details about this work.

## Installation

See `INSTALL.md` for instructions.
